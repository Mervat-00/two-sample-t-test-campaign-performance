# two-sample-t-test-campaign-performance
A hypothesis testing using a two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the sales performance of five marketing campaigns. The statistical analysis of the sales data using the two-sample t-test revealed that the fifth campaign generated significantly higher total sales than the other four campaigns. However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the first, second, and fifth campaigns in terms of sales. Therefore, it can be concluded that the first, second, and fifth campaigns can be considered as the best-performing campaigns in terms of sales performance, although the fifth campaign had the highest sales. This conclusion is based on an appropriate statistical analysis of the sales data using a predetermined level of significance, which suggests that the observed differences in sales are unlikely to have occurred by chance.
